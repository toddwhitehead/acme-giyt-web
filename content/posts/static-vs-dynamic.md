Understanding the difference between static and dynamic websites is crucial when choosing the right technology for your project.

## Static Websites

Static websites are pre-built HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that are served directly to users. Benefits include:

- **Scalability**: Easy to scale with CDNs
- **Cost**: Lower hosting costs
- **Simplicity**: Easier to maintain

## Dynamic Websites

Dynamic websites generate content on-the-fly based on user interactions and database queries. They're ideal for:

- Complex user interactions
- Real-time data updates

- Social networks
