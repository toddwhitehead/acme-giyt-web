Welcome to the official support site for the presentation **"The Wile E. Coyote Approach to AI for Backyard Beast Management"** by Todd Whitehead, scheduled for the Brisbane Azure User Group meetup on February 11, 2026.

## 📢 About the Presentation

Australia's backyard fauna are nature's ultimate chaos engineers. In this fast-paced, demo-heavy session, we'll channel our inner Wile E. Coyote—optimistic, iterative, occasionally singed—and show how combining AI, IoT, and a bit of ACME-grade creativity can turn your backyard, deck, and shed into a humane, real-time defence system. Then, using MCP and Azure, we'll turn over control to Agentic AI: what could possibly go wrong?
