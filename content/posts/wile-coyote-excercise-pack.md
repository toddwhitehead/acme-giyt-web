## Wile E. Coyote Leadership Exercise Pack
A set of activities for teams to internalize the seven traits of the framework.

## Purpose Fixation Exercises

### North Star Compression
Rewrite a current project goal until it fits into a single, precise sentence.

### Alignment Mapping
List your top ten weekly tasks and map each to your North Star. Tasks without alignment become candidates for redesign or removal.

## Iterative Mastery Exercises

### Failure‑as‑Data Debrief
Document:
- What was attempted
- What happened
- What the data suggests
- What the next iteration should be

### Rapid Re‑Prototype
Redesign the original approach in five minutes using only the extracted learnings.

## Systems Orchestration Exercises

### Workflow Decomposition
Diagram a process using inputs, dependencies, and outputs.

### Bottleneck Hunt
Swap diagrams and identify single points of failure, unmonitored steps, and over‑coupled components.

## Constraint Creativity Exercises

### Constraint Box Challenge
Solve a problem using only three randomly selected constraints.

### ACME Product Simulation
Design a solution assuming one critical tool is unreliable.

## Resilient Neutrality Exercises

### Emotional Reset Drill
Identify a personal trigger and write a reset script including a grounding phrase, a neutral observation, and a next action.

### Non‑Escalation Scenarios
Role‑play tense situations and practice responding without blame or escalation.

## Accountability Loop Exercises

### Decision Traceback
Document a recent decision with assumptions, risks, outcomes, and learnings.

### Public Learning Share
Share one learning from the traceback with the group.

## Ethical Persistence Exercises

### Boundary Definition
Define one ethical boundary you will not cross.

### Pressure Simulation
Practice holding that boundary in a scenario where it is tested.

## Integration Exercises

### Leadership Operating Model
Combine outputs from all exercises into a one‑page personal operating model.

### Seven‑Day Application Plan
Choose one behavior to apply for the next seven days and define the trigger, action, and expected impact.
